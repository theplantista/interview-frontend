# Interview with Frontend Focus - Embedded Experience

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with building a product that can be embedded on 100+ websites. Each website has their own settings that impact the way the product should render on their site; those settings include: Logo and Primary Brand Color. This embedded experience will also have a form that asks the user a few questions, and after a submit, the user will receive a response based on the data that they sent to the form. This product will be on 100 websites that might be shown to 20,000+ users per month.

In this exercise, it is up to you to decide how you want to implement this. We would like to see your code, and also a written summary of why you went with your implementation approach. Keep in mind various factors like: ease of implementation, best visual and user experience, speed, responsiveness, and any others youâ€™d like to include. You are not required to build any backend.

To submit your work, you can provide us with a link to your code and a document or readme that includes your written summary. 

**Evaluation Criteria**
- Code Readability and Maintainability
- Functioning Code (does it run?)
- Handling the cases in the problem statement
- Tech decisions and implementation approach based on the problem statement

We look forward to reviewing your approach. If you have clarifying questions, please reach out to us.
